# specialRelativity_unity
Length contraction simulator in Unity.

This is a quick project I threw together in finals week some semesters ago. It was meant to give some distraction when needed.

In the project folder you can find everything necessary to run the project on your local unity program. Just import it and it should run.

A build for the iphone is also included, or can be contructed from the project. A VR headset for your phone will be needed to view the game properly.

The project is quiet large, so it may be advisable to only copy the scripts relevent, which are lengthContraction and playerControls in the assets folder. Those are the main scripts which control the movement and special relativity effect. 

Those scripts can be deployed on any environment as long as you label the environement "Town" and add a camera and the VR scripts necessary (by Google) to your player. 

Some documentation for the scripts is included in the scripts. They should give simple instructions as to how it can be used.
